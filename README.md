# Fashion Lookbook Site 

I created a website that allows users to view, post, edit/ delete different fashion post. Similar to lookbook, I wanted to create a webssite that allowed users to inspire others by posting different styles or be inspired.

User stories 

This app functions similar to a lookbook page or pinterest, I wanted to make it easy to navigate and well organized for the user. 

MVP Goals

-MVC file structure
-CRUD MODEL
-implemented routes: index, edit, new, delete, post 


Stretch Goals

-signup & login (didn't get to add this but will definitely add this function later); would like to exclude posting, editing, and deleting options to  users who have signed up.
